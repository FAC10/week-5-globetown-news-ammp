# User Story:
Most students at F&C seem to experience the impostor syndrome. Occasionally they're so overwhelmed by everything that they just feel like running away. In such cases, they want to know all the train departure times from Bethnal Green tube station, so that they can run ... wherever...whenever. 

# Strech Goals:
- add a refresh iconn and button at the top of the page;
- when the weather isn't great, our users want to run straight to the airport and jet off to a sunny destination; include a new travel section showcasing how to get to Luton, Stansted, Gatwick and Heathrow Airport.
